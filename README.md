This repository contains two exercises in recursion written in Ruby.

The first one generates the Fibonacci sequence, first using iteration and second using recursion.

The second one is an implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)).

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/recursion)
